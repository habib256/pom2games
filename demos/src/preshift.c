/* preshift.c -- PRESHIFT: pre-shifted HGR sprite engine (the "Buzzard Bait" method).
 *
 * Apple II port of POM1's sketchs/gen2/demo_preshift (VERHILLE Arnaud 2026,
 * GPL-3.0). Buzzard Bait itself runs single-buffered on a real Apple II, which
 * has no V-blank signal: the GEN2 version's wait-for-V-blank becomes a one-frame
 * pause (Monitor WAIT), which keeps the ball's speed; any key returns to the
 * DEMO menu. Runtime = dev/lib/hgrc. Sprite banks: preshift_sprites.h, built
 * from preshift_sprites.txt by POM1's tools/build_preshift_sprites.py.
 *
 * Shows the pre-shifted sprite engine: each sprite is baked into 7 pre-shifted
 * phases offline (sprites.txt -> sprites_ps.h, built by
 * tools/build_preshift_sprites.py), so a 1px-precise blit is just "pick the phase
 * for x%7, byte-blit at x/7" -- no per-pixel shifting.
 *
 * SINGLE-BUFFER + V-blank sync, exactly how Buzzard Bait does it -- and it is
 * flicker-free because the ball uses gen2_hgr_sprite_xor, the ALL-ASM XOR fast
 * path (no cc65 wrapper: x/7, x%7, phase offset and edge clip are done in asm).
 * That keeps the erase+redraw pair inside V-blank, so the beam never catches a
 * mid-update (the general gen2_hgr_sprite C path was ~3-4x heavier and spilled
 * past V-blank into the top scanlines). POM1's GEN2 renderer is also beam-
 * accurate (latches per scanline, frozen per frame at the rollover).
 * XOR is non-destructive, so the green floor and the ship survive.
 *
 * Build:  make   (demos/)  ->  dist/DEMO.dsk, BLOAD PRESHIFT + CALL 24576 */
