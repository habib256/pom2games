## 1. What is APPLE-1 LOGO?

APPLE-1 LOGO V2.6 is a complete LOGO turtle interpreter that runs on a
real Apple-1 (or POM1 emulator) equipped with the **P-LAB TMS9918
Graphic Card**. It draws on the TMS9918's 256×192 bitmap (Mode 2) using
the chip's hardware sprites for animated turtles.

It is a *real* LOGO with:

- A turtle that responds to `FORWARD`, `RIGHT`, `LEFT`, `HOME`, etc.
- User-defined procedures with parameters and recursion.
- Variables and a single level of arithmetic in argument position.
- `IF` / `IFELSE` / `STOP`, `REPEAT`, `REPEAT FOREVER` (ESC-abortable).
- A unified colour command, hardware sprite turtles, bitmap text.
- A fullscreen line editor for procedures (`EDIT`) and a proc dumper
  (`LIST`).
- Two slideshows (`DEMO`, `DEM2`) for showing off.

Source: `TMS_Logo_16k.asm`, linked at `$4000` and shipped on the
CodeTank daughterboard (upper bank). Flip the CodeTank jumper to
**Upper** and start the interpreter with `4000R` from Wozmon.

---

## 2. Setup and First REPL

### In POM1

1. Launch POM1 and pick **Preset 9** (P-LAB Apple-1 with TMS9918 +
   CodeTank daughterboard).
2. Flip the CodeTank jumper to **Upper** in the Hardware menu, then in
   Wozmon (the `\` prompt) type:
   ```
   4000R
   ```
3. The TMS9918 screen opens, the turtle (a small triangle) appears at
   centre, and the prompt waits:
   ```
   APPLE-1 LOGO FOR TMS9918 - TYPE HELP
   (C) 2026 VERHILLE ARNAUD
   ?
   ```

### On a real Apple-1

You need an Apple-1, the P-LAB TMS9918 card, and the CodeTank
daughterboard. Flash `Codetank_BASIC_LOGO.rom` into the 28C256, set the
jumper to **Lower**, then type `4000R` from Wozmon. (The upper bank of that
same cartridge holds the Applesoft TMS9918 interpreter.)

### Saying hello

Try:
```
PRINT "HELLO
```
The console echoes `HELLO`. The `?` prompt comes back.

Try a turtle move:
```
FD 60
RIGHT 90
FD 60
```
Two perpendicular trails of 60 pixels each.

Always available:
```
HELP
```
prints the table of contents. `HELP 1` through `HELP 8` page through
the topical sections (turtle, console, variables, procs, dynamic
turtle, demos, errors).

`BYE` returns to Wozmon.

---

## 3. The Turtle

The turtle has a position `(x, y)` in pixel coordinates (0..255 × 0..191,
origin top-left), a heading in degrees (0 = north, 90 = east), and a
pen state (down / up).

### Movement

| Command | Aliases | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `FD n` | `FORWARD n` | move `n` pixels in the current heading; if pen down, draw a trail |
| `BK n` | `BACK n` | move `n` pixels backward |
| `TR n` | `RIGHT n` | turn right (clockwise) by `n` degrees |
| `TL n` | `LEFT n` | turn left by `n` degrees |
| `SETXY x y` | | jump to `(x, y)` |
| `SETH n` | | set heading to `n` degrees (mod 360) |
| `HOME` | | jump to centre `(128, 96)`, heading 0, pen state preserved |

`n` is unsigned 0..65535. Negatives are not parsed; use `BK` instead
of `FD -n`.

### Pen

| Command | Aliases | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `PD` | `PENDOWN` | turtle leaves a trail |
| `PU` | `PENUP` | turtle moves silently |

`HOME` preserves pen state — a `PU + HOME` keeps the pen up so the
next moves don't draw a line back to the origin.

### Screen

| Command | Aliases | What it does |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| `CS` | `CLEARSCREEN` | clear the bitmap (pixels only, not the colour table); `HOME` is implicit |

### A first picture

## 4. Colour: the single SETPC command

V2.6 has exactly one colour command:

```
SETPC n         (n = 0..15)
```

It drives **every** colourised surface simultaneously:

- the turtle's **trail**;
- the **bitmap arrow** (the default ARROW shape) — its outline
  cells are repainted live;
- the **sprite-0** turtle (any other `SETSHAPE` value) — the sprite
  attribute is re-emitted with the new colour;
- **bitmap text** drawn by `LABEL` and the visual editor (`LIST` /
  `EDIT`).

The TMS9918 palette (Mode 2):

| `n` | Colour | `n` | Colour |
|-----|--------|-----|--------|
| 0 | transparent | 8 | medium red |
| 1 | black | 9 | light red |
| 2 | medium green | 10 | dark yellow |
| 3 | light green | 11 | light yellow |
| 4 | dark blue | 12 | dark green |
| 5 | light blue | 13 | magenta |
| 6 | dark red | 14 | grey |
| 7 | cyan | 15 | white *(default)* |

`SAY` (the speech bubble, see §9) is the one exception — it forces the
bubble outline and glyph cells to white for readability, then restores
your `pen_color` so subsequent commands keep the user-chosen tint.

### Examples

```
SETPC 11        ; yellow
REPEAT 5 [FD 80 RIGHT 144]      ; 5-point yellow star
```

```
SETPC 9         ; red
SETSHAPE "ANGRY ; sprite turns red on the fly
```

The old V2.5 `SETTC` / `SETSC` commands are gone.

---

## 5. Repetition and Control Flow

### REPEAT

```
REPEAT N [ ... ]
```

Run the bracketed block `N` times. Blocks may contain any commands,
including more `REPEAT`s and proc calls.

```
REPEAT 36 [ FD 5 RIGHT 10 ]   ; circle
```

```
REPEAT 12 [ REPEAT 6 [ FD 25 RIGHT 60 ] RIGHT 30 ]   ; rosette
```

### REPEAT FOREVER

```
REPEAT FOREVER [ ... ]
```

Loops until you press **ESC** or **Ctrl-G**. The interpreter aborts
cleanly: any procs you defined are still there.

### IF / IFELSE

```
IF a OP b [ ... ]
IFELSE a OP b [ yes-block ] [ no-block ]
```

`OP` is one of `<`, `>`, `=`, `<=`, `>=`, `<>` (not equal). `a` and `b`
can be literal numbers or `:VARNAME` references.

```
IF :SIZE > 100 [ STOP ]         ; common spiral termination
IFELSE :N = 0 [ PRINT "ZERO ] [ PRINT "NONZERO ]
```

### STOP

`STOP` exits the current procedure immediately. Inside `REPEAT`, the
loop unwinds and `STOP` propagates to the enclosing proc.

### Quitting

```
BYE
```

Returns to Wozmon (if you launched LOGO from there).

---

## 6. Variables and Arithmetic

### MAKE

```
MAKE NAME N
```

Create or update a variable named `NAME` with value `N`. `NAME` is up
to **6 characters** (A-Z, 0-9). Leading underscores are not allowed.

### Reading

`:NAME` evaluates to the variable's value.

```
MAKE SIZE 50
FD :SIZE
```

### Arithmetic in argument position

Each argument supports a **single** operation:

```
FD :size + 2
TR 360 / :n
SPIRAL :s - 1 :a
```

Allowed operators: `+ - * /`. Multiplication and division are 16-bit
unsigned. There is no nesting: `:a + :b + 1` is **not** parsed as a
chain — write it as a temporary `MAKE`.

### RANDOM

```
RANDOM N
```

Returns a number in `0..N-1`. Backed by a 16-bit LFSR seeded at boot.

```
REPEAT 80 [ FD RANDOM 20 RIGHT RANDOM 90 ]
```

### Limits

- 12 named variables maximum (the table is small to leave room for
  procs).
- 6-character name cap — `THING` and `THING1` stay distinct, but
  `LONGNAME` and `LONGNAMA` collide on the first 6 chars.

---

## 7. Procedures: TO / END

```
TO NAME :p1 :p2 ... :pK
  body line 1
  body line 2
  ...
END
```

Defines a procedure. **10 procs** of up to **224 bytes** of body each.
Up to **2 named parameters** per proc (`:p1 :p2`).

### Calling

Just type the name:
```
NAME 10 20
```

Each argument is evaluated and bound to the corresponding parameter.
Inside the body, `:p1` and `:p2` resolve to those values.

### Tail recursion is free

If a proc's last statement is a recursive call, the interpreter
**reuses the current frame** — no stack growth. So `SPIRAL` (below)
runs ~50 logical levels in a single frame:

```
TO SPIRAL :SIZE :ANGLE
  IF :SIZE > 100 [ STOP ]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT :ANGLE
  SPIRAL :SIZE + 2 :ANGLE
END

SPIRAL 0 90
```

### Non-tail recursion

When a proc calls another proc inside `REPEAT` or before the last
statement, a **control frame** is pushed (64 bytes). The control stack
is 16 frames deep, so `THING1 = REPEAT 4 [ THING ]` and similar nested
patterns work freely.

### Procedure scope

Parameters live in dedicated slots that take precedence over global
variables of the same name. After the call returns, your global
variables are intact.

```
MAKE SIZE 20            ; global
TO BOX :SIZE
  REPEAT 4 [ FD :SIZE TR 90 ]
END
BOX 50                  ; uses parameter (50)
PRINT :SIZE             ; still 20
```

### Aborting / clearing

There is no `FORGET NAME` in V2.6 — defining a proc with the same
name overwrites it. To reset to a clean slate, `BYE` and re-launch.

---

## 8. Dynamic-turtle sprites: SETSHAPE

```
SETSHAPE "NAME
```

(Note the leading double-quote — it's the LOGO syntax for a literal
word.)

Swaps the on-screen turtle for a 16×16 hardware sprite. Available
shapes:

**Locomotion:**
- `BIRD1`, `BIRD2` — wings up / down (alternate for flapping)
- `TURTL` — chunky turtle
- `BOAT` — small sailboat

**Narrator emotes** (used by `DEM2`):
- `NORMAL`, `SHADES`, `SAD`, `UPSET`, `SICK`, `SUPER`, `GRUMPY`,
  `HAPPY`, `PIRATE`, `SLEEP`, `PERV`, `ANGRY`

**Sentinel:**
- `ARROW` — switches back to the bitmap-triangle turtle (the default)

The first non-`ARROW` `SETSHAPE` flips the VDP into 16×16-sprite mode
and erases any visible bitmap arrow so the two render paths don't
ghost each other. Going back to `ARROW` re-enables the bitmap path.

The sprite tint follows `pen_color` (set via `SETPC`) — see §4.

### Animating a flap

```
TO FLY
  SETSHAPE "BIRD1
  FD 4
  TR 12
  PAUSE 1            ; ~100 ms hold
  SETSHAPE "BIRD2
  FD 4
  TR 12
  PAUSE 1
END

PU                   ; pen up so we don't trail the flight
HOME
REPEAT 30 [ FLY ]
```

`PAUSE 1` is roughly 100 ms at 1 MHz — long enough to register both
wing positions visually. Without it, each frame is ~1 ms and the wings
blur.

---

## 9. Bitmap text: LABEL / SAY

The interpreter embeds the 1 024-byte Apple-1 charmap so it can render
text directly into the TMS9918 bitmap (separate from the Apple-1
character display).

### LABEL

```
LABEL "TEXT
```

Print `TEXT` (multi-word, until CR or `]`) on the bitmap starting at
the current turtle position. 8×8 glyphs from `roms/charmap.rom`. Each
glyph advances `tx` by 8.

### SAY

```
SAY "TEXT
```

Comic-book speech bubble. Draws a 240×32 px frame at
`(8, 80)-(247, 112)` with a triangular tail pointing up to `(128, 72)`,
then prints up to **3 lines of 28 chars** wrapped automatically (no
word-boundary detection — text breaks mid-word at the right margin).
Lines past the bottom are silently truncated. The pause length is
proportional to the number of lines (~2.4 s per line at 1× speed).

The bubble outline and glyph cells are forced to **white** while
rendering, then `pen_color` is restored. So a green sprite + a SAY
shows a white bubble framed around a green character.

### LIST

```
LIST [NAME]
```

Dump the body of proc `NAME` (or all procs if no argument) to the
bitmap. Useful for "show me what I just typed" sessions.

### EDIT

```
EDIT NAME
```

Open a fullscreen visual editor for proc `NAME`'s body. Shortcuts:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Ctrl-K | move cursor up |
| Ctrl-J | move cursor down |
| (printable) | overwrite at cursor |
| Ctrl-X | save and exit |
| Ctrl-Q | abort |

After saving, the proc is the new body and the REPL is back. The
classic ARROW turtle is restored.

---

## 10. Built-in demos

```
DEMO
```

Bitmap-turtle slideshow. Each scene picks its own `SETPC`:

`STAR`, `SUN`, `ROSETTE`, `RANDOM`, `FLOWER` (defines + calls
`SQUARE`/`FLOWER`), `SPIRAL91` (defines + calls `SPIRAL`, deep tail
recursion), `HEXAGON`, `STAR7`, `BURST`, `PINWHL`, `KALEID`, `GARDEN`,
`CIRCLES`, `RAYS`, `BIRDFLY` (figure-8 sprite flight), then resets the
arrow turtle and every colour to white before printing `END`.

The procs `SQUARE`, `FLOWER`, `SPIRAL`, `BFR`, `BFL`, `BFLY` are
**defined live** inside the demo — they survive in the REPL afterwards,
so you can call `FLOWER` again, `SPIRAL 0 91`, etc.

```
DEM2
```

Narrator-mode slideshow. POM1 (the dreamer in the emulator) tells its
own life story through the 12 emote sprites + bitmap-text bubbles. The
**ill** scene tints the sprite green; the **angry** scene tints it red.
Bubble text stays white throughout.

---

## 11. Tutorials by example

Each tutorial assumes a fresh REPL (or just a `CS` to clear).

### 11.1 — Polygons in one line

A regular N-gon is `REPEAT N [FD step TR (360/N)]`:

```
CS
SETPC 5
REPEAT 6 [ FD 45 TR 60 ]            ; hexagon
```

Replace `6` with any divisor of 360. For 360/N to be an integer,
common Ns are 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 60, 72, 90.

### 11.2 — Stars (non-convex polygons)

A star is what you get when you turn by **more** than `360/N`:

```
CS
SETPC 11
REPEAT 7 [ FD 70 TR 154 ]           ; 7-point star, 154 ≈ 360 - 360/7 + ε
```

```
CS
SETPC 9
REPEAT 9 [ FD 70 TR 160 ]           ; "burst" 9-pointed
```

### 11.3 — A square procedure with a parameter

```
TO SQUARE :SIZE
  REPEAT 4 [ FD :SIZE TR 90 ]
END

CS
SETPC 3
SQUARE 30
TR 90
SQUARE 50
TR 90
SQUARE 70
```

Three squares of growing size, each rotated 90° from the last. Try
calling `SQUARE 100` directly — the proc lives at the REPL until
`BYE`.

### 11.4 — A recursive flower

```
TO SQUARE
  REPEAT 4 [ FD 50 TR 90 ]
END

TO FLOWER
  REPEAT 36 [ TR 10 SQUARE ]
END

CS
SETPC 13                            ; magenta
FLOWER
```

`FLOWER` calls `SQUARE` 36 times, rotating the canvas 10° between
each. `SQUARE` runs at every step using a *non-tail* call (the call
is followed by another iteration of `REPEAT`). This pushes one control
frame for the duration of `SQUARE` and pops it when `SQUARE` returns,
so the 16-frame stack handles arbitrary nesting.

### 11.5 — Tail-recursive spiral (no stack growth)

```
TO SPIRAL :SIZE :ANGLE
  IF :SIZE > 100 [ STOP ]
  FORWARD :SIZE
  RIGHT :ANGLE
  SPIRAL :SIZE + 2 :ANGLE
END

CS
SETPC 7                             ; cyan
SPIRAL 0 90                         ; classic right-angle spiral
```

About 50 levels of recursion in a single frame. Try `SPIRAL 0 91` for
a beautiful "spiral that just barely closes" curve, or `SPIRAL 0 144`
for a star-shaped spiral.

### 11.6 — IFELSE

```
TO COIN
  IFELSE RANDOM 2 = 0 [ PRINT "HEADS ] [ PRINT "TAILS ]
END

REPEAT 10 [ COIN ]
```

Ten coin flips, printed to the Apple-1 console.

### 11.7 — Dynamic-turtle bird flight (figure 8)

```
SETPC 11                            ; yellow bird

TO BFR
  SETSHAPE "BIRD1
  FD 3
  TR 12
  PAUSE 1
  SETSHAPE "BIRD2
  FD 3
  TR 12
  PAUSE 1
END

TO BFL
  SETSHAPE "BIRD1
  FD 3
  TL 12
  PAUSE 1
  SETSHAPE "BIRD2
  FD 3
  TL 12
  PAUSE 1
END

TO BFLY
  REPEAT 8 [ BFR ]
  REPEAT 8 [ BFL ]
END

PU                                  ; no trail during flight
HOME
BFLY
SETSHAPE "ARROW                     ; restore the bitmap arrow
PD
```

Each `BFR` / `BFL` is one wing-flap cycle that nets +24° / -24° of
turn. 8 of each makes a 192° lobe — slightly more than a half-circle,
giving the figure-8 its bulged shape.

### 11.8 — Coloured speech bubble

```
CS
SETXY 128 64
SETPC 3                             ; sprite turns green
SETSHAPE "SICK
SAY "I AM ILL.
SETPC 9                             ; sprite turns red
SETSHAPE "ANGRY
SAY "EMULATION IS NOT LIFE!
SETPC 15                            ; back to white
```

Even though `SETPC` colours the sprite, the bubble text stays white
because `SAY` overrides for its rendering window.

### 11.9 — Random-direction rays

```
CS
SETPC 8
REPEAT 36 [ PU HOME PD SETH RANDOM 250 FD 70 ]
```

36 rays from centre, each in a random direction.

### 11.10 — Combining everything

```
TO PETAL :LEN
  REPEAT 18 [ FD :LEN TR 10 FD :LEN TR 170 ]
END

TO MEADOW :N
  IF :N = 0 [ STOP ]
  PU
  SETXY RANDOM 200 RANDOM 150
  PD
  SETPC RANDOM 14 + 1
  SETH RANDOM 250
  PETAL 8
  MEADOW :N - 1
END

CS
MEADOW 12
```

12 random-coloured petals scattered across the screen. Demonstrates
parameters, recursion (tail), `RANDOM`, `SETXY`, `SETPC`, `SETH`,
inner `REPEAT`.

## 13. Limitations

V2.6 ships at **99.6 % of its 16 KB ROM cap**. This dictates many of
the limits below.

### Language

- **2 named parameters** per procedure. Workaround: pack into vars.
- **6-character identifier limit** for vars and procs (`THING1`,
  `THING7` are distinct; `LONGNAME` and `LONGNAMA` collide).
- **Single arithmetic op** per argument — `:a + :b * 2` is not parsed
  as a tree. Decompose with intermediate `MAKE`s.
- **No negative number literals** — use `BK` for backward moves.
- **No string variables / lists** — there is no first-class word /
  list type beyond `PRINT "WORD`.
- **No `FORGET NAME`** — re-defining overwrites; cleaner state needs
  `BYE` then re-launch.

### Storage caps

| Resource | V2.6 cap |
|----------|---------:|
| User variables | 12 |
| User procs | 10 |
| Proc body length | 224 bytes |
| Control stack (non-tail recursion) | 16 frames (1024 B) |
| Line buffer (single REPL line) | 60 chars |
| `RANDOM N` argument | 1..255 (it caps internally at 8-bit) |
| TMS9918 bitmap | 256×192 px |
| Sprite-0 turtle size | 16×16 px |

### Performance

- Bitmap-arrow movement: ~12 000 cycles (= ~12 ms at 1 MHz). Trail-only
  movement: ~3 000 cycles per pixel of trail. A 100-px `FD 100` takes
  about a third of a second visible (perceptible).
- `RANDOM N` is fast (LFSR step + reduction), microseconds.
- Sprite movement: ~50 cycles (4-byte attribute write).
- A `REPEAT 10000 [ ... ]` loop is **not** instantaneous — interpreter
  overhead per iteration is ~200 cycles.

### Hardware

- Requires the P-LAB TMS9918 Graphic Card (Mode 2).
- CodeTank daughterboard plugged into the TMS9918 card. The interpreter
  uses the upper Apple-1 RAM bank (`$E000-$EFFF`) for `PROCBSS`.
- Cannot coexist with cards that share the `$CC00`/`$CC01` window
  (e.g. A1-AUDIO SE) — see CLAUDE.md "one board at a time" rule for
  POM1's preset-level mutexes.

### What V2.6 does NOT have

- **Floating-point arithmetic** — integer 16-bit only.
- **Word lists, strings, records** — no `WORD`, `LIST`, `BUTFIRST`,
  `FIRST`, etc.
- **Dynamic dispatch / `RUN`** — you cannot evaluate a string as code.
- **Files / I/O** beyond the keyboard / TMS9918 / Apple-1 console.
- **Multiple sprites** — only sprite-0 is used.
- **Sprite-position updates without redraw lag** of the bitmap arrow
  for the static (`ARROW`) case (since save/restore is ~12 000 cycles
  per move).

## 14. Internals (for the curious)

### How the bitmap arrow works (option B, V2.6)

Earlier revisions drew the bitmap-triangle arrow with **XOR over the
trail** — fast (idempotent restore by drawing twice), but it inverted
trail bits while the arrow was visible and lost a corner pixel from
each vertex (the line walker plotted shared endpoints twice, XOR'd
even-count = invisible).

V2.6 ditched XOR for **save/restore** (option B):

1. Compute the 3 triangle vertices from the heading (`compute_turtle_verts`).
2. Snapshot a **4×4 cell (32×32 px) bounding box** anchored on
   `(tx_lo - 9, ty_lo - 9)` snapped to the cell grid, clamped to the
   256×192 screen. 16 cells × 8 pattern bytes = **128 bytes** saved.
3. Draw the 3 lines with `plot_set` in OR mode. Trail bits are *added
   to* (not toggled by) the arrow.
4. On erase / move: write the 128 saved bytes back verbatim. The
   bitmap is restored bit-for-bit.

Why 4×4 and not 3×3: the tip extends ±9 px from `(tx, ty)` in any
direction, and a 24 px box anchored on the cell grid can leave the tip
1 cell outside the saved region when the turtle sits in the second
half of a cell — which produced the V2.5 "leftover pixel at the tip"
bug. 32 px (4 cells) covers ±15 px and clears the whole range.

The save and restore use a single shared body (`arrow_io_bbox`)
selected by an `arrow_io_dir` flag, with the two entry points using
the classic 6502 `LDA #imm / .byte $2C / LDA #imm` BIT-skip trick.

### Why SETPC affects sprite-0 colour too

The TMS9918 stores sprite-0's colour in the sprite attribute table
(VRAM `$3B00..$3B03` for sprite 0: Y, X, name, colour). `draw_turtle`
re-emits these 4 bytes every time the turtle moves, reading
`pen_color` for the colour byte. So `SETPC` changing `pen_color`
naturally propagates to the sprite at the next draw — and `cmd_setpc`
calls `draw_turtle` immediately so the change is visible without
waiting for the next move.

### Why SAY forces white

The bitmap text glyphs are written by `blit_glyph`, which writes both
the pattern bytes and the colour-table bytes. If `pen_color` were
green (because the sprite is "ill"), the bubble glyphs would be green
too — unreadable on a busy bitmap. `cmd_say` swaps `pen_color = 15`
(white) for the duration of `draw_bubble + cmd_label`, then restores
the caller's `pen_color`.

### Why is the line buffer only 60 chars?

The 6502's address modes make 256-byte buffers cheap and 128-byte
buffers cheaper. The interpreter's parser scratch lives in the LBUF
zone (`$0200-$027F`, 128 B total), which also holds `tx0..ty2`,
`plot_mode`, `turtle_visible`, etc. The line buffer is what's left:
60 chars + null terminator + counters. The 4 extra bytes that V2.6's
arrow save/restore needs (`arrow_rows_left`, `arrow_cols_left`,
`arrow_bx`, `arrow_io_dir`) ate into that margin — which is why the
128-byte arrow pattern buffer itself lives in PROCBSS, not LBUF.

V2.6 layout (CodeTank, jumper Upper):

```
$0000-$001F  ZP scalars (math + tms9918m2 imports)
$0020-$00FF  ZP free
$0100-$01FF  6502 stack
$0200-$027F  LBUF: line buffer + parser scratch
$0280-$0FFF  free Apple-1 RAM (programmer's playground)
$4000-$7FFF  CODE: 16 KB ROM, interpreter linked + run-in-place
$E000-$EFFF  PROCBSS: control stack + var/proc tables + arrow save buf
              (upper Parmigiani RAM bank, 4 KB)
```

TMS9918 VRAM layout (Mode 2):

```
$0000-$17FF  pattern table (6 144 B = 256x192 / 8)

```

I/O (TMS9918):

```
$CC00  VDP_DATA (read/write VRAM at the cursor)
$CC01  VDP_CTRL (set VRAM cursor / register writes)
```

Apple-1:

```
$D010  KBD       last key, bit 7 = 1 means new key
$D011  KBDCR     bit 7 = 1 when key ready
$D012  DSP       write = display char
$E000  Integer BASIC ROM (untouched by LOGO)
$FF00  Woz Monitor (BYE returns here)
