/* gen2_init.c — initialisation, look-up tables, page management.
 *
 * Always linked (every gen2c consumer pulls at least the table builder via
 * gen2_build_tables). Carries the soft-switch sink, the HIRES + LORES
 * cross-module globals and the draw-page setter. See
 * gen2.h for the public API doc; see gen2_internal.h for what the other
 * modules import.
 *
 * NO INITIALIZED GLOBALS (the BSS-zero-default rule). The cc65 -t none crt0
 * used by every consumer has NO copydata: a DATA-segment initializer is only
 * "applied" because the loader happened to place the bytes — it is one-shot
 * under load==run configs (a warm re-run inherits the previous run's values)
 * and pure garbage under ROM configs (DATA in ROM is never copied to RAM).
 * Even `= 0` lands a variable in DATA. So every global here is uninitialized
 * (BSS, zeroed by zerobss at EVERY entry) and encodes its default as zero:
 * flags default clear, gen2_draw_page2 zero = page 1, and the page bases
 * (for which 0 is never a legal value) are lazily defaulted at their read
 * sites (gen2_hgr_row / gen2_build_tables here, gen2_lores.c for LORES, and
 * _gen2_hgr_clear in gen2_blit.s — the one asm reader of gen2_hgr_base). */

 * the (volatile) load that feeds it is always emitted. The whole-mode init
