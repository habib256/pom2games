/*
 * snake.c — Snake for the Apple II+ hi-res screen (cc65, DOS 3.3).
 *
 *   Snake for the Apple II / VERHILLE Arnaud 2026
 *   Original: GEN2Snake.c (POM1, Apple-1 + Uncle Bernie's GEN2 HGR card)
 *   Licence: GPL v3 (same as the upstream sketch)
 *
 * The classic game on the 280x192 HIRES screen. Apple II port of POM1's
 * sketchs/gen2/game_snake_telemetry: gameplay and drawing are unchanged (the
 * GEN2 card is the Apple II video subsystem, so its C runtime — src/gen2c —
 * only needed the $C050 soft switches). What changed:
 *   - the POM1 telemetry side channel is gone ($C440-$C443 is slot 4's I/O
 *     space on an Apple II — a Mockingboard lives there);
 *   - keyboard through the $C000 latch (dev/lib/apple2c), arrow keys added;
 *   - the per-frame GEN2 mode re-assert (a POM1 renderer workaround) is gone.
 *
 *   Build : make            -> ../dist/SNAKE.dsk
 *   Run   : make run        (POM2, Apple ][+ profile)
 *
 * Controls: I J K L or the arrow keys (left/right on a II+, all four on a //e).
 *
 * --- Cell -> pixel mapping -------------------------------------------------
 * The 280x192 HIRES screen is divided into 8x8-pixel CELLS: 35 columns
 * (0..34, x = col*8) by 24 rows (0..23, y = row*8). A snake segment / the food
 * fills a 6x6 block inside its cell (a 1px gap on the right + bottom keeps the
 * grid readable). Top + bottom walls only (1px rules); the left/right sides are
 * OPEN — the snake wraps horizontally from one edge to the other.
 *
 * --- Visuals & gameplay ----------------------------------------------------
 * Snake = white blocks; the apple = a SOLID RED disk (orange is HIRES's warmest
 * tone — there is no true red); the bonus = a SOLID GREEN block; the score reads
 * in WHITE via the flicker-free gen2_hgr_putu_field HUD renderer (top-right);
 * the "HGR Snake" label sits top-left in cycling violet/green/orange/blue
 * (mixed case shows off BBFont's lowercase glyphs). HIRES colour
 * is a byte-pattern artifact (the tint keeps only ~half the pixels), so the game
 * sprites are drawn FILLED — a hollow outline gets halved into scattered dots.
 * Gameplay extra: every BONUS_EVERY apples a time-limited bonus gem appears for
 * BONUS_TTL ticks — grab it before it fades for BONUS_POINTS extra points (no
 * growth, so it is pure risk/reward).
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
