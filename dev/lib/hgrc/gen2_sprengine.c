/* gen2_sprengine.c -- masked save-under sprite ENGINE for GEN2 HGR (cc65).
 *
 * The SPRENGINE family (needs SPRMASK + CORE): up to GEN2_SPR_MAX opaque
 * masked sprites over an arbitrary background, restored byte-exact every
 * frame. The per-sprite state lives in cc65-friendly PARALLEL STATIC ARRAYS
 * (no structs of pointers, no dynamic allocation) and every blit goes through
 * the gen2_ms_* zero-page parameter block into the gen2_sprmask.s kernels --
 * the same ZP-block discipline as the rest of the runtime.
 *
 * === HST0, the flip, and the V-blank budget (why this engine is shaped so) ==
 *
 * HST0 poll idiom. The GEN2 soft switches $C250-$C257 are READ-only; a read
 * toggles the addressed switch AND returns HST0 (the blanking flag) in bit 7:
 * 1 during H-blank (hcnt 0-24) OR V-blank (lines >= 192). The low 7 bits are
 * floating bus -- never use them. Two hardware traps shape every poll:
 *   (a) the 3-cycle colour-burst notch at hcnt 13-15 can read HST0 = 0 even
 *       in the middle of a blank, so a single sample lies: always OR TWO
 *       samples >= 4 cycles apart (gen2_wait_vbl's gen2_blank() does
 *       `GEN2_SS[7] | GEN2_SS[7]` -- two indirect reads are ~6 cycles apart);
 *   (b) the read IS the toggle, so you must poll a switch you are already IN.
 *       gen2_wait_vbl polls $C257 (re-asserts HIRES -- harmless in HIRES);
 *       this engine's flip is a $C254/$C255 READ (gen2_show_page), which is
 *       both the page selection AND a valid HST0 sample point for the same
 *       reason: reading the page switch you are switching to costs nothing
 *       extra and cannot disturb any other latch.
 *
 * V-blank budget. A frame is 17030 cycles at ~60 Hz; the V-blank window is
 * ~4200-4550 cycles (24-26 blanked lines x 65 cycles, minus what the poll
 * itself burns before returning -- gen2_wait_vbl returns ~3 lines in). Cost
 * of one sprite of stride S x H rows through this engine, per frame:
 *
 *     draw    (gen2_msu_run)        35 cyc/byte  (save-under fused in)
 *     restore (gen2_ms_restore_run) 19 cyc/byte
 *     + per-row overhead  ~200 cyc  (2 passes x rowbase + 3-pointer advance)
 *     + per-call overhead ~1200 cyc (2 x setup: deref, clip, h*stride
 *       loop-add, phase offset)
 *
 *     T(S,H) ~= 54*S*H + 204*H + 1200
 *
 * So a 3x8 sprite costs ~4.1k cycles (JUST fits one V-blank window), a 3x16
 * ~7.1k (does NOT -- ~0.6 of one fits 4200 cycles), a 16x16 creature (stride
 * 4, 64 bytes) ~7.9k. Hence the TWO modes:
 *
 *   double-buffered (the default to reach 8 sprites): all restore+draw work
 *     happens on the HIDDEN page while the beam scans the other -- the budget
 *     is the whole frame (17030 cycles), and the only thing inside V-blank is
 *     the flip itself. Tear-free BY CONSTRUCTION, whatever the sprite load.
 *     Each page holds a 1-frame-old background, so under-buffers and
 *     "previous position" are kept PER PAGE.
 *
 *   single-buffered: gen2_wait_vbl() FIRST, then restore-all + draw-all
 *     inside the V-blank window. Cheaper (no second background copy, no page
 *     discipline) but the budget math above applies: past ~1 small (3x8)
 *     sprite the beam catches the update mid-frame and you see a tear/flash
 *     near the top scanlines. The overflow only ever TEARS -- the save-under/
 *     restore pairing stays coherent, so the background is never corrupted.
