 *        a pure NTSC ARTIFACT: uncontrollable, parity-dependent, but compact.

 *        editor's ×2 export byte-for-byte.

 * PARITY CONTRACT (×2): the sprite must land on an EVEN pixel column — byte-
 * aligned, an even byte column, x = 14*n — or the hue flips (Violet<->Green,
 * Blue<->Orange): HIRES colour is parity-locked. Move ×2 sprites in steps of 2 px
 * (pixel-precise paths) or 14 px (byte-aligned blit7).

 * GEN2_X2_* is one hue for the whole sprite; the order matches the editor's

 * gen2_hgr_sprite gives BOTH: byte-aligned blit speed AND 1px-precise x.
 *
 * The trick (lifted from Sirius' 1983 arcade engine, see
 * sketchs/gen2/a2port_buzzard_bait/DISASSEMBLY.md S3): the sprite is baked
 * OFFLINE into 7 PRE-SHIFTED copies, one per sub-byte phase (x % 7 == 0..6).
 * At runtime the engine just selects the phase for x%7 and does a byte-aligned
 * blit at column x/7 -- zero per-pixel shifting; the inner loop is gen2_blit7.
 *
 * Cost: 7x the sprite's bytes (static data -- "free"). Build the 7-phase bank
 * with tools/build_preshift_sprites.py (emits a gen2_sprite_t + its data, C or
 * asm). Same SET/CLEAR/XOR modes; XOR is the sweet spot (draw==erase, no
 * backbuffer, decor preserved). Example:

 *   stride = ceil((w + 6) / 7) bytes per row (uniform across the 7 phases;
 *            phase 6 spills one extra byte to the right).
 *   bits   = 7 contiguous phase blocks, each h*stride bytes, row-major,
 *            7px/byte (bit 0 = leftmost, bit 7 = 0). Phase p starts at
 *            offset p*(h*stride). Pixel (row,col) of phase p lives at packed

 *                             free — it re-derives the scanline tables, so set it

 *

 *
 *     unsigned char draw = 2;
 *     gen2_hgr_init();
