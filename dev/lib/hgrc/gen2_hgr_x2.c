/* gen2_hgr_x2.c — mono ×1 sprite → ×2 single-colour inflate (gen2_hgr_inflate_x2).
 *
 * On HIRES a sprite has no CHOSEN colour: at ×1 its colour is a pure NTSC artifact
 * (Woz's trick), parity-dependent and uncontrollable — but compact, the mono bytes
 * ARE the sprite. To get a deliberate colour you DOUBLE the sprite: each source
 * pixel becomes a 2×2 block spanning one full NTSC colour clock, lighting the even
 * OR odd dot of the pair (+ the palette high bit for the blue/orange group) instead
 * of both, so the doubled sprite reads as that one hue instead of solid white.
 *
 * This is the 6502/cc65 twin of the editor's HgrSpriteBlit::magnifyColor2x — the
 * SAME transform, so a sprite authored ×2 in the POM1 HGR Sprite editor and one
 * inflated here from its mono ×1 master come out byte-identical (pinned host-side
 * by hgr_inflate_x2_smoke). Keep the two in lock-step.
 *
 * Recommended use is INFLATE-ONCE: store the compact mono ×1 (e.g. 48 B for a
 * 16×16), inflate to its ×2 form (192 B) once at init into your own buffer, then
 * blit that buffer every frame with gen2_hgr_blit7 / gen2_hgr_sprite. See gen2.h
 * for the ×2 parity contract (an even byte column keeps the hue). */

/* HOST-ONLY reference implementation. The TARGET build uses the hand-written
 * gen2_hgr_x2.s instead, because cc65 2.18 `-Oirs` (the standard gen2c flag)
 * MISCOMPILES this C: whatever the loop shape, the optimizer decides the inner
 * pixel-setting body is dead and drops it (computes the source-bit test, then
 * just does sx++, emitting ZERO stores into `out`) — so every x2 sprite inflated
 * to all-zero on the 6502. Confirmed juillet 2026 by reading the -Oirs asm. The
 * asm is fast and immune; this C stays only to cross-check the algorithm on the
 * host (hgr_inflate_x2_smoke vs HgrSpriteBlit::magnifyColor2x). `#if !__CC65__`
 * keeps it out of every cc65 build so it can never clash with the .s symbol. */
