/* gen2_preshift.c — Buzzard-Bait-style pre-shifted sprite blit (gen2_hgr_sprite).
 *
 * The "missing middle" of the GEN2 blit family: gen2_hgr_blit is 1px-precise
 * but slow (per-pixel mask walk); gen2_hgr_blit7 is byte-fast but snaps x to a
 * 7px grid. This one is BOTH fast AND 1px-precise, by trading memory: the sprite
 * is pre-shifted into 7 phase copies OFFLINE (build_preshift_sprites.py), and at
 * runtime we just pick the phase for x%7 and reuse the proven byte-aligned blit
 * kernel (gen2_blit7_run) at column x/7. No per-pixel shifting at all.
 *
 * This is a pure C clipping/selection wrapper around the asm kernels in
 * gen2_blit.s. Speed matters here: a single-buffer XOR program must fit its
 * erase+redraw inside V-blank (~4550 cyc) or the beam catches it mid-update
 * (flicker), so this path is tuned the Buzzard-Bait way:
 *   - x/7 and x%7 come from the gen2_col7[] / gen2_phase7[] TABLES, not cc65's
 *     16-bit software divide (~150-300 cyc each — the dominant per-call cost);
 *   - GEN2_XOR (the hot animation path) uses gen2_preshift_xor_run, a dedicated
 *     XOR loop with no per-byte mode dispatch (~24 vs ~34 cyc/byte).
 * See gen2.h for the data ABI and DISASSEMBLY.md (S3) for the method. */
